  "description": "I'm a Front End software developer. I started learning front end in December 2015, at Brain Academy courses, I studied layout, styling, Less, Grunt builder, and of course JavaScript. At the moment I am studying such technologies as TypeScript, webpack 2, Angular 2. I am open to new knowledge and technologies, and most importantly - I dream to work in a big team of professionals, from which I could learn a lot, be able to improve my knowledge and skills and could bring benefit to the project with my work. And also I can speak English very well."
